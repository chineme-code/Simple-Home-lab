# Simple-Home-lab
This project demonstrates how to set up a home security information and event management (SIEM) lab using Elastic SIEM with a Kali Linux VM, sending data from the Kali VM to Elastic SIEM, generating security events, and analysing the logs through dashboards and alerts.

## **Project Objective:**

This project aims to set up a home lab using Elastic SIEM and a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM) to help me gain practical experience in security monitoring and incident response. I will forward data from the Kali VM to the SIEM using the Elastic Beats agent, generate security events on the Kali VM through Nmap scans, and then analyze those logs within the Elastic web interface. Additionally, I will create dashboards to visualize the security events and set up alerts to detect potential threats. Through this hands-on approach, I aim to build the essential skills needed to become a proficient security analyst or engineer.

## Project Components:
